title=Define the Monitoring Scope
defineScopeDesc=You define the monitoring scope by including specific jobs or groups of jobs and excluding specific programs or groups of programs. You can create multiple entries for job inclusions and program exclusions. The resulting scope becomes a subject of permanent performance monitoring by the Performance Management Assistant component (PMA) of MAT that is running on mainframe. From the resulting monitoring scope, you further include particular jobs in your performance analysis while configuring specific pipelines to monitor the performance of the jobs under test.
defineScopeDesc2=Define the monitoring scope after you have successfully defined the communication profiles.
defineScopeDesc3=When you access or update this page, the plugin communicates with mainframe to retrieve the current monitoring scope details. The retrieval process may take time depending on your connection and mainframe response speed. The progress bar indicates the current status of data retrieval. Please wait for the process to complete before you update the monitoring scope details.
